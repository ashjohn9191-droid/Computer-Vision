# 🚶 Pedestrian (Full Body) Detection in Video using OpenCV

## 📌 Project Overview

This project implements **Pedestrian Detection (Full Body Detection)** in a video file using **Haar Cascade Classifier** in OpenCV.

The system processes each video frame, detects multiple human bodies, and draws bounding boxes around detected pedestrians in real-time.

This project demonstrates practical implementation of **Video Processing + Object Detection using classical Computer Vision techniques**.

---

## 🚀 Technologies Used

* Python 🐍
* OpenCV
* NumPy
* Haar Cascade Classifier

---

## 🧠 How It Works

1. Load the `haarcascade_fullbody.xml` classifier.

2. Open the input video file using `cv2.VideoCapture()`.

3. Read frames one by one.

4. Convert each frame to grayscale.

5. Detect full human bodies using:

   ```python
   detectMultiScale()
   ```

6. Draw bounding boxes around detected pedestrians.

7. Press **Enter key** to exit the program.

## ⚙️ Installation

### 1️⃣ Install Required Libraries

```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy
```

### 2️⃣ Download Haar Cascade File

Download from OpenCV official repository:

[https://github.com/opencv/opencv/tree/master/data/haarcascades](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/tree/master/data/haarcascades)

Download:

```
haarcascade_fullbody.xml
```

Place it inside your project folder.

## ▶️ How to Run

Update the video path inside the script:

```python
video_path = "sample_video.mp4"
```

Run the project:

```bash
python pedestrian_detection.py
```

Press **Enter key** to stop execution.

## 🔍 Detection Parameters

```python
scaleFactor = 1.2
minNeighbors = 3
minSize = (50, 50)
```

* **scaleFactor** → Controls scaling of detection window
* **minNeighbors** → Reduces false positives
* **minSize** → Minimum body size to detect

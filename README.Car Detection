# 🚗 Car Detection in Video using OpenCV (Haar Cascade)

## 📌 Project Overview

This project implements **Car Detection in Video** using the Haar Cascade Classifier in OpenCV.

The system processes each frame of a video file, detects multiple cars, and draws bounding boxes around detected vehicles in real-time.

It demonstrates classical object detection using traditional Computer Vision techniques.

---

## 🚀 Technologies Used

* Python 🐍
* OpenCV
* Haar Cascade Classifier
* NumPy

---

## 🧠 How It Works

1. Load the `haarcascade_car.xml` classifier.

2. Open the input video file using `cv2.VideoCapture()`.

3. Read frames continuously.

4. Convert each frame to grayscale.

5. Detect cars using:

   ```python
   detectMultiScale()
   ```

6. Draw bounding boxes around detected vehicles.

7. Press **Enter key** to exit the program.

## ⚙️ Installation

### 1️⃣ Install Required Libraries

```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy
```

### 2️⃣ Download Car Haar Cascade File

You need:

```
haarcascade_car.xml
```

Place it inside your project folder.

## ▶️ How to Run

Update the video path inside the script:

```python
video_path = "sample_video.mp4"
```

Run the program:

```bash
python car_detection.py
```

Press **Enter key** to stop execution.

## 🔍 Detection Parameters Used

```python
scaleFactor = 1.1
minNeighbors = 3
minSize = (30, 30)
```

* **scaleFactor** → Controls image scaling during detection
* **minNeighbors** → Reduces false detections
* **minSize** → Minimum size of detectable car
